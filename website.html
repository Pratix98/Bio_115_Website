                A parasitic relationship is a type of symbiotic relationship where the parasite is an organism that uses the host organism for it's own benefit, such as obtaining food, protection, or other resources, and in return, harming the host. <br>
                There are three main kinds parasites that can affect humans: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Protozoa </li>
                <li> Helminths </li>

                Protozoa are a type of single-celled parasite that don't need a host to survive. While in a parasitic relation with a human, they are able to freely multiply which helps increase their survival rate, along with that it causes infections in the host body. <br>
                The transferring of protozoa that live in the intestine oftens occurs through the fecal-oral route, this typically happens by ingesting dirty food or water. Transferring of protozoa that live in the blood or tissure often occurs through an arthopod vector, this is typically from the bite of a mosquito.

                Helminths are a multi-cellular organisms that, like protozoa, don't need a host to survive. In their adult form, they are visible to the naked eye and cannot multiply in their host's body. <br>
                Some forms of helminths are:
                <li> Flatworms - Which contain flukes and tapeworms </li>
                <li> Thorny-headed Worm - Which tend to live in the host's gastrointestinal tract </li>
                <li> Roundworms - Which tend to live in the host's gastrointestinal tract, blood, lymphatic system or subcutaneous tissues.</li>

            <p>
                Ectoparasites is a rather broader term for organisms such as ticks, fles, mites and lice, this is due to the fact that all these organisms are dependent on their host in some form or another. <br>
                Arthropods are another form of ectoparasites, this includes mosquitos since they depend on the blood of their hosts as a food source, however they also serve as a transmitter to transport other pathogens.

                While zombies may not be real, <i> as far as we know </i>, zombie parasites are very real. <br>
                These parasites infect their hosts and essentially turn them into zombies. The parasites use "mind control," which is really a complicated release of chemicals in the host's body causing them to become a zombified organism which serves the parasite entirely.

            </div>
            <p>
                The zombie ant fungus is a parasite that typically resides in the rainforests of Thailand, Africa and Brazil where it infects ants.
                This process occurs when a parasitic fungus spore infects an ant that is foraging the forest floor, this spore then spends three to nine days growing and developing inside the host's body. Once it is fully developed, it manipulates the host through chemical release to leave the path and go towards trees. Once the ant has climbed twenty-five centimeters up a tree, to an area with the right humidity for the fungus the grow, the ant will bite down on a leaf and die. Twenty-fours after death, the ant will grow fungal threads and a stalk will push through the ant and pour spores onto the rainforest floor to continue the cycle.

            </div> 
            <p>
                The kamikaze horsehair worm larva begins its journey by being eaten by a larva of another insect, for example mosquito, and the the mosquito is eaten by a cricket or grasshopper. This begins the development phase of the worm, in order to complete the development process, the worm must find its way back to water. The worm does this by altering the cricket's central nervous system and forces it to jump straight into the water. This causes the cricket to drown and the worm to emerge and begin reproduction. This is the cycle that the kamikaze horsehair worm follows.

                The Sacculina sp. finds its way into the host body, a crab, through a narrow opening in the crab's claw joint. From there, the barnacle feeds off the nutrients in the crab, along with that the barnacle uses the crab as a vehicle of reproduction. If the crab is female, it will force it to care for millions of it's egg. If the crab is a male, it will be castrated to make it suitable, along with that the crab will grow a larger abdomen, lose it's gonads and stop development of it's claws - all from a barnacle!

            <p>
                The emerald cockroach wasp resides in tropical areas like Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands. It begins it's parastic journey by stinging a cockroach with a paralyzing attack. From there it injects neurotransmitters into the cockroaches mind which essentially turns the cockroach into a zombie. After chewing off the cockraoch's antennae, it will lead it to the nest and lay eggs on the cockroach's abdomen. While the eggs are growing, wasp feeds on the cockroach. After the eggs fully grow, they burst out of the cockroach's carcass.

                This single celled parasites infects rats and mice with the end goal to be eaten by cats. Once the rats and mice are infected by the parasite, the parasitse makes them lose their innate sense of fear of cats and instead become attracted to the pheromones in the cat's urine. Putting themselves in the crosshairs of the cat makes them quick and easy prey for cats. <br>
                Along with that, between thirty and sixty percent of people are infected with toxoplamosis. While it is uncertain what the effects of it is on humans, some evidence of human personality change has been found.

            <p>
               The Costa Rican wasps begin their journey of infecting the host, a spider, by temporarily paralzying the spider and laying eggs on its abdomen. Once the egg hatches, the larvae will feed off the spider while the spider continues it's normal functions. Once the larvae is ready to pupate, it will inject a chemical in the spider's brain which forces it build a web that is designed to hold the cocoon for the pupate; this cocoon supporting web is unlike anything the spider has made before. The larvae will then kill the spider and build a cocoon on the web, and emerge to begin the cycle again.

               The rabies virus doesn't seem to be much of a virus, but in reality it really is; they benefit the parasite while negatively affecting the host.<br>
               This virus is spread through saliva, usually from a scratch or a bite. Usually dogs or bats begin the spreading of the virus. It can spread to humans too making them more aggresive and begins to blur the line between humans and animals.

                While zombies may or may not be real is a question that is yet to be answered, parasites that can make host into a zombie is definitely real. These parasites can use a complicated release of chemical compounds after infecting their host to make their obey the parasite's every will. <br>
                While parasites tend to use their host for food, protection or some other resource, these zombie creating parasites use their host in manipulative ways and force them to do the parasites bidding. This can be helping the parasites infect other organisms by making the host climb heights so they can rain spores onto others, or it can be forcing an organism to commit suicide in the water to allow the parasite to develop or anything inbetween. <br>
                Thankfully there are no parasites that are capable of making humans into zombies, <i> or is there? </i>
